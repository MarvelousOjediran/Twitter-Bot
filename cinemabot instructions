This will basically check when the bot has been @'d then like the tweet and Post the "absolute cinema" meme as a reply.
If you would like to, you can copy this and change the image to anything you want. 
Also make sure you fill in your api keys in an .env environment to not get leaked when you want to try this. 
I currently don't have a demo for this as you need a developer account to use advanced bots but the code will work.
